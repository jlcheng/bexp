I'm revisiting bexp, as recently I've had difficulties with using the Search Engine.
Problem 1: High CPU use in the 4gt indexing server. Cause unknown.
Problem 2: Certain queries fails to return results.

This calls for revisiting existing code, documenting them, and purging obsolete experiments.

The learning from today's work on token_filter_replace_test.go is that while the TokenFilter interace is clean and
simple, bleve's registry API is anything but. If you want to use a custom TokenFilter, you need to also create a
corresponding TokenFilterConstructor implementation.
